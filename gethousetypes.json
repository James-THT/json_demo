There is also a separate dining area, a handy cloakroom to house coats and shoes. There is also the addition of another generous room that can be used as a bedroom, playroom, or a dedicated office. \n\nUpstairs you’ll find a large master bedroom and a generous second bedroom. The third bedroom is located on the ground floor, but it could easily be transformed into a handy playroom or a home office. There is a large driveway to the front of the property that can easily accommodate two cars.",
